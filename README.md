# Portfolio

## Description
Portfolios are an essential part of becoming a web developer. They allow potential employers to review samples of work and assess candidacy for open positions. 

This portfolio project focuses on applying recently learned core HTML skills with advanced CSS. This portfolio contains samples of recent work, an about me section, contact information, and a contact form.

The 'About Me'' section includes a recent photo of myself along with a few fun facts. Within the 'Projects' section, there are three coding samples and one large graphic design sample displayed. Finally, the 'Contact'section includes links to my email, GitHub, and LinkedIn, along with a contact form to leave a message.
